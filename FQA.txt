FQA

1. What is Node ?
Nodes are building block of Godot, almost everything is made out of nodes. There are different types of nodes, each with a specific function. Node that shows image of player, 
or show text on the screen.

2. What is Scene?
Scenes is just a bunch of nodes grouped together, like player and level.

3.What is Viewport 2D/3D ?????

4.What is func _ready(): 
Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time

5.What is func _process(delta):
Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame

6. What are Assets
Assets are individual components that make game world, they are music,sprites,animations

7. What is Vector2
It is type of variable that contains two types of floats inside of it, they are represented with (x,y). Vector2 shows us the DIRECTION the player is moving in.
Position and scale uses vetor2
VECTOR 2 -> Left(-1,0) Right (1,0) Uo (0,-1) Down (0,1) Right+Down(0.70,0.70), 0.70 because player would move faster if pressed both axis at the same time
	var move_vector: Vector2 = Input.get_vector("move_left","move_right","move_up","move_down")

8.CharacterBody 2D Grounded/Floating
For games like super mario we would use grounded because he has gravity (he can only move left,right and jump), 
but if characters needs to go in all directions we woul duse floating as motion mod
	
9. @export
Exporting variables to property editor to have them visible and editable in the editor

10. AnimationPlayer / AnimatedSprite2D
AnimatedSprite2D -> We work with spritesheets (many images of some actions in one image file)

11.$ sign 
To fetch some nodes functionality in script of some other node

12.Tilemaps (TilemapLayer Node)
A technique in 2D games that allows creating level by placing blocks (Tiles)
In Godot we can select multiple tiles and click on dice for random settings

13.Terrains
In TilemapLayer Node under Tile Set go to Terrains Sets and then add elements

14.Obstacles
Through Tilemap layer add new tileset and add atlas importing trees terrain for example but we will 
choose ourself a tile size. We click on tile and select tool and drag that one tile to be whole 
image of tree.

15.Y-sorting
Technique that says which object should be in fron of other object depending on where it is.
Player behind tree wont be visible, in fron of tree part of tree wont be visible and player
cant go through tree (Enable Y sorting under Orderling on obstacle tilemap layer).
 Put player node under obstacle tilemap layer. 
In tileset -> rendering -> Texture origin -> Y = 14 PX

16.Signals
Signals are way to run specific part of code whenever an event happens (player touched coin or user clicks a button)
Every node has each ser of signals.

17.Area2D
A region of 2D space that detects other CollisionObject2Ds entering or exiting it.

18.Changing a scene
get_tree().change_scene_to_file.call_deferred("path/to/scene/file")
